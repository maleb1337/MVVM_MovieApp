Hello, this a test which basically consists of a MovieApp, who shows a list of movies and their details.

To use this project, first you need to register to the movie db official page (https://www.themoviedb.org/) and then when you are ready, 
you'll need to get an API KEY from the following these steps on this page -> https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

Lastly, when you have your API KEY, you'll need to replace this on gradle properties file 
Line 20th api_key_moviedb="ENTER_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

Greetings and Happy Coding !
